# RSpec: Best practices

Paweł Gościcki @ [GetAirHelp.com](https://www.getairhelp.com/)

Gdańsk, 2014-08-19

# Use `--format documentation`

And use a global `~/.rspec` file

```bash
☺ cat ~/.rspec
--color --format documentation --profile 5
```

---

# Don't use the `should` keyword

Not in docstrings

```ruby
it 'creates a new claim' do
```

Nor in specs

```ruby
it { is_expected.to be_valid }
```

---

# Use the [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) gem

Relationships:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to belong_to(:flight) }
it { is_expected.to have_one(:passenger) }
```

Validations:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to validate_presence_of(:name) }
it { is_expected.to validate_uniqueness_of(:email) }
```

Controller responses:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to respond_with(:success) }
it { is_expected.to render_template('new') }
it { is_expected.to redirect_to(new_claim_path) }
```

---

# Use proper docstrings

When writing specs for methods:

```ruby
describe '#instance_method' do
describe '.class_method' do
```

For other types of specs:

```ruby
it 'creates a new claim' do
```

---

# Use `context` properly

`context` should be used mainly to denote two different code path executions (side note: having two code paths execution is a code smell - there should be only one; there should be no `if` statements).

It's good to start it with *when*:

```ruby
context 'when there is an existing claim by this user' do
  it ...

context 'when there are no existing claims by this user' do
  it ...
```

---

# Use `let() { ... }`

```ruby
describe CreateAccount do

  describe "#call" do
    let(:user_id) { rand(100) + 1 }

    let(:params) do
      {
        email: "test@test.com",
        name: 'Test Test'
        user_id: user_id,
      }
    end

    let(:create_account) { CreateAccount.new(params) }

    it 'creates Account with user_id set' do
      account = create_account.call

      expect(account.user_id).to eql(user_id)
    end
```

`let` provides an indirection in code (you have to scroll constantly to understand the spec), but if you have many similar examples, it's advised to use `let.`

---

# Use `let!`

If you have to, that is if you need the code in the `let` block to be executed before the spec is executed. For example we might need to have a record in the database before the spec is run:

```ruby
let!(airline) { create(:airline) }

it 'updates Claim with ...' do
  ...
  expect(claim).to ...
```

`let` is lazily evaluated, so if you don't call it directly, it will not be there. While when using `let!` it will be called just like if it were in a `before` block.

---

# But don't overuse `let`

It's ok to write a comprehensive spec with all variables declared inside the spec:

```ruby
it 'does not save the account if there are validation errors' do
  account_params = { user_id: nil }
  create_account = CreateAccount.new(account_params)

  account = create_account.call

  expect(account).to be_a(Account)
  expect(account).not_to be_valid
  expect(account).not_to be_persisted
end
```

---

# Write unit specs at unit level

In other words - stub all external dependencies (external to the class currently being tested):

```ruby
class CreateAccount

  def call
    create_account
  end

  def create_account
    Account.create(...)
  end

end
```

`Account` is an external dependency here (it's a method execution on an external class), so in order to test it at a unit level, calls to it should be mocked out (using `expect().to receive()`)

Internal (local to the class) methods should not be mocked out.

---

# Divide specs into parts

If your specs are longer, divide them into parts like `setup`, `expectations` and `execution`.

```ruby
it 'calls CreateAccount if account does not exist' do
  user_id = 12211
  create_account = double 'CreateAccount'
  create_account_params = { user_id: user_id }

  expect(Account).to receive(:find_by).with(user_id: user_id).and_return(nil)
  expect(CreateAccount).to receive(:new).with(create_account_params).
    and_return(create_account)
  expect(create_account).to receive(:call)

  FindOrCreateAccount.new(create_account_params).call
end
```

---

# Don't write specs for private methods

```ruby
class CreateAccount

  def call
    create_account
  end

  private

  def account_params
    {
      email: email,
      name: name,
      user_id: user_id,
    }
  end

  def create_account
    Account.create(account_params)
  end

end
```

It's sufficient to test public methods (`#call` in this case). Private methods will be tested indirectly anyway.

---

# Test for all possible cases

```ruby
describe '#show' do
  context 'when claim is found' do
    it 'shows the claim' do
      ...

  context 'when claim is not found' do
    it 'responds with :not_found error' do
      ...

  context 'when claim is not owned' do
    it 'responds with :unauthorized error' do
      ...
```

It might be hard to see all the possible cases, but you should try to think of what could go wrong, which params could be set incorrectly and write a spec for that case.

---

# Use shared examples

In `spec/support/shared_examples/model_with_attachment.rb`:

```ruby
shared_examples 'model with attached' do |attribute|
  it 'allows adding an attachment' do
    file = File.join(...)
    attachment = Rack::Test::UploadedFile(file)
    model_name = described_class.name.downcase

    model = create(model_name, attribute => attachment)

    expect(model).to be_valid
    expect(model.public_send(attribute).file.path).to be_identical_to(file)
  end
end
```

And then in the spec:

```ruby
describe Message do
  it_behaves_like 'a model with attached', :attachment
```

---

# Write controller specs at unit level

```ruby
describe ClaimsController do
  describe '#create' do
    let(:airport) { double 'Airport', icao: 'GDN' }
    let(:create_claim) { double 'CreateClaim' }
    let(:claim_params) do
      {
        email: ...,
        ...
      }
    end

    before do
      expect(Airport).to receive(:find).with(icao: icao).and_return(airport)
      expect(CreateClaim).to receive(:new).with(claim_params).and_return(claim)

      post :create, claim: claim_params
    end

    it { is_expected.to respond_with(:success) }
    it { is_expected.to render_template(:show) }
```

We don't test that the object was created in the database. A simple expect on `CreateClaim` is enough. The proper way is to write an acceptance spec, which will actually test that the datbase records are created.

---

# Use `factory_girl`

If you need to setup your database with data, using `factory_girl` (or some other factory gem) is the recommended way of doing it. The proper place for using it are acceptance specs (Capybara):

```ruby
describe 'Claims' do
  background do
    @airline = create(:airline, :lot)
    @airport_gdn = create(:airport, :gdn)
    @airport_waw = create(:airport, :waw)
    @flight = create(:flight, :gdn_waw, :cancelled)
  end

  scenario 'Filing a claim for a cancelled flight' do
    visit ...
```

I prefer not to use `let(..)` inside acceptance specs because I'd have to use `let!` all over the place. I also think they read better as instance variables in a `before` block (but only for acceptance specs!).

---

# Stub HTTP requests

All HTTP requests should be stubbed (using the [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) gem).


```ruby
describe PayoneerGateway do

  describe '#sign_up_url' do
    let(:url) { '...' }
    let(:payoneer_uri) { 'https://api.payoneer.com/sign_up_url?user_id=151' }
    let(:body) { Hash[url: url].to_json }

    before do
      stub_request(:get, payoneer_uri).to_return(status: :success, body: body)
    end

    it 'calls Payoneer API to fetch the sign up url' do
      payoneer_gateway = PayoneerGateway.new(...)

      response = JSON.parse(payoneer_gateway.sign_up_url)
      sign_up_url = response["url"]

      expect(sign_up_url).to eql(url)
```
